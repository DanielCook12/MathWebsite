How do you want to communicate since Mrs. Brown is out and there is no webex?
https://scps.webex.com/meet/pr5924003803


Can you please upload your image to Git?
what image
The icon image in the top of the page
Also, I am not sure how to do the things you suggested for smaller screens, do you have any ideas? I think i'll just give up on it since from what i've found it should work fine without it, and it would take a long time to fix it.
The image should be in the git repository, it's called favicon.ico

Join the Webex that's linked up there, i have it running
