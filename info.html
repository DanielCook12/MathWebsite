    </p>
    <h2 class="sub">Function</h2>
    <p class="content">
      You can click and drag the shapes and your fuctions around the Math Balance area. The balance will tilt to whichever side has the highest apparent or literal value, although it may take a few seconds for the scale to update, so be patient. Click the mouse again to release the object your holding.
